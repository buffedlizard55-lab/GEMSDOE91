# GEMSDOE91 — Unique TIF submission pass log

> **Historical entry below describes an earlier branch (`arena/e6fdea6b-gemsdoe91`), not the current checkout.** Current branch: `arena/2f002fa0-gemsdoe91`. Current three-pass review: `docs/REVIEW-SESSION-20261025.md`; no new TIFF/experiment/slot, lane paragraph missing, feature stack absent; current verdict negative. The sample and existing-fault catalogue are present only as SHA-verified audit references. The earlier unique artifact is still research-only and not endorsed for submission. The prior policy omission for that artifact has now been corrected and `scripts/check_artifact_policy.py` passes.

## Session context
Branch: arena/e6fdea6b-gemsdoe91 (active). Pinned data restored:
- data/official/sample_submission.tif (EPSG:32611, 3730x3292, 100 m, footprint 5,167,373 px)
- data/official/existing_faults.tif (catalogue, 60,988 px)
- data/registry/GEMSDOE32__h33-2-b2-zeros.tif (registry parent R0)
- data/registry/gemsdoe32-h33-h33-2-b2-20261004T220000Z-e5eb6e7e-nan.tif

## Goal
Generate a UNIQUE TIF submission, easy to download, values in [0,1], CRS/shape/transform match, no NaN inside footprint, zero catalogue mass, >=3 px collar, validated without human intervention, with an obvious OK TO DOWNLOAD / OK TO SUBMIT verdict.

## Pass 1 — implement (DONE)
- [x] Wrote scripts/build_unique_submission.py (off-catalogue damage-zone annulus lattice)
- [x] Ran via scripts/submission_writer.py (shared tool, triple gate suite): CERTIFIED
- [x] Validated with scripts/validate.py: PASS (all gates true, 8718 dots, min cat dist 3.1623 px)
- [x] Validated with scripts/validate_raster.py: PASS (all must-pass gates, values [0,1], zero catalogue mass, sha256 new)
- [x] Registry uniqueness (Rule-1 LANE): surface |rho|=0.00983 (<=0.90), dot 3px overlap=20.67% (<=70%), NOT a duplicate
- [x] Holdout-DTI: 0.0 CI [0,0] (deliberate off-catalogue negative; honest)
- [x] Published TIF/ZIP/audit to docs/downloads/; ZIP single-member, inner TIFF matches disk
- [x] Wrote docs/run-card-unique-offcatalogue-damagezone.json
- [x] Updated README.md top verdict + download link

## Pass 2 — review (DONE)
- [x] All gates PASS / CERTIFIED; no FAIL or UNVERIFIED
- [x] Uniqueness vs registry PASSES (not a duplicate)
- [x] Note 140 chars; name < 140 chars
- [x] Download link + verdict obvious in README

## Pass 3 — final (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Commit + push to arena/e6fdea6b-gemsdoe91
- [ ] Open PR from this branch to main, merge
- [ ] Report limitations / next steps

## Verdict
OK TO DOWNLOAD: YES — FORMAT-CERTIFIED, UNIQUE (8,718 unit dots, all values in [0,1], EPSG:32611 3730x3292, zero catalogue mass, 3.16 px min catalogue distance).
OK TO SUBMIT: NO — RESEARCH NEGATIVE. HOLDOUT-DTI = 0.0 by design (off-catalogue damage-zone dots cannot cover withheld catalogue faults). No DrivenData authentication available to confirm organizer acceptance or live score; no weekly slot spent. Not a score-improvement candidate.
